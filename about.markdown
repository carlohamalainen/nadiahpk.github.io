I am a research scientist specialising in evolutionary and ecological modelling, 
currently working with the <a href="https://arcsaef.com/">Securing Antarctica's Environmental Future</a>
team in the <a href="https://qutameg.wordpress.com/">Applied Mathematical Ecology Group</a>
at <a href="https://www.qut.edu.au/">QUT</a>.

I am interested in modelling <a href="/category/cooperation">cooperation</a> particularly,
and how game theory and related techniques can give us insights into the 
<a href="https://www.ats.aq/index_e.html">Antarctic Treaty System</a>.
Other interests include
<a href="/category/evolutionary_ecology">ecoevolutionary models</a>
and <a href="/category/food_webs">food webs</a>.

Previously,
I was at the <a href="https://ryanchisholm.com/">The Chisholm Lab</a> at National University of Singapore,
and collaborated 
with <a href="http://www.esb.soken.ac.jp/english/research/hisashi_ohtsuki.html">Hisashi Ohtsuki</a>
on modelling the evolution of [cooperation](https://nadiah.org/category/cooperation).
I also worked on [neutral theory type models](https://nadiah.org/category/macroecology) 
and statistical models for [estimating dark extinctions](https://nadiah.org/category/undiscovered_extinctions).

Before that, 
I worked on [nonparametric methods for estimating undetected extinctions](/category/undiscovered_extinctions).
Before that, I was [at University of Queensland](http://x-ed.net/), Australia, working on the [Qualitative Modelling](https://nadiah.org/category/qualitative_modelling) framework in the context of pest control. 
Before that, I was in [Lund, Sweden](https://www.biology.lu.se/research/research-groups/theoretical-population-ecology-and-evolution-group), using adaptive dynamics to model the phenological response of migratory birds to climate change. 
And before that, I did a post-doc at CSIRO Entomology in Canberra, and did my PhD with Hugh Possingham at the University of Queensland. 
Both of these focused on complex systems, mathematical ecology and modelling.

I have a son, Toivo, who was born in the Czech Republic while my [partner](https://carlo-hamalainen.net/) did his first post-doc there. While on an extended parenting leave I volunteered at [the local rodinné centrum (family centre)](http://www.rcletna.cz/), I started my own Fair Trade business, volunteered to organise and run two children&#8217;s playgroups including one that served the large refugee community in Annerley/Moorooka ([Junction Park Playgroup](http://junctionparkplaygroup.blogspot.com.au/), [Monday Melodies Playgroup](http://mondaymelodiesplaygroup.blogspot.com/)), volunteered to organise Fair Trade events including the annual Fair Trade Christmas Market for the [Qld Fair Trade Collective](https://www.facebook.com/qldfairtrade/), and volunteered for the [Stones Corner Community Kindergarten](http://www.stonescornerkindergarten.com.au/) committee.

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking with my family, riding my bike, and listening to death metal.
