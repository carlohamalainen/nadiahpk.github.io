I just found a pretty early reference to the possibility of climate change leading to asynchrony between plant and animal phenology. From Chapter 10 page 295 of [Climate Change: The IPCC Scientific Assessment (1990)](https://web.archive.org/web/20181102160618/http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_ipcc_first_assessment_1990_wg1.shtml)

> Of crucial importance in plant community functioning is the synchronous operation of the life cycles of interacting plants, animals and soil organisms. Complex synchronies are found in communities in which the life cycles of plants and pollinating and seed-dispersing animals must be closely linked. Changes in climate could disrupt these synchronies. 

Unfortunately it didn't attribute the idea to a reference. I wonder who was the first to come up with it?
