There is a typo in our recent paper to _MEE_, [Dealing with high uncertainty in qualitative network models using Boolean analysis](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.13179). Example 2 of Box 1 should read "_y_ = water/wine" not "_y_ = wine/water". Many thanks to [Anubhav Gupta](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anubhav_Gupta6) at University of Zurich for emailing us to let us know.
