Yesterday, I had the pleasure of teaching Year 12 students at
<a href="https://www.ais.com.sg/">Australian International School</a> about
eco-evolutionary modelling.

I created a simplified version of the mathematical model from 
<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2015.0288">my paper in Proceedings of the Royal Society B</a>
so they could solve it during class.
