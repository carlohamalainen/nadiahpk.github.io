Our [new paper](https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1azsh790mrudp)
about using the Tea Bag Index in the tropics, headed by [Aloysius
Teo](https://sg.linkedin.com/in/aloysius-teo), has just come out
in _Pedobiologia_.

The [Tea Bag Index (TBI)](http://www.teatime4science.org/)
was designed by [Keuskamp et al.
(2013)](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.12097)
as a standardised and cheap method to quantify microbial-driven
decomposition by measuring the mass loss of tea within tea bags. It
can be used by scientists and citizen-scientists alike.

However, we found that when the TBI was deployed in tropical forests,
termites damaged up to 80% of the tea bags. Termites also consumed
the recalcitrant fraction of tea, which is needed to calculate
microbial decomposition. In our experiments, TBI estimates could
only be retrieved only 20% of the tea bags deployed. This implies
that the original TBI cannot be used efficiently in termite-rich
tropical ecosystems.

To protect the bags from termites, we tested two methods: physical
exclusion with wire mesh and chemical treatment with termite
repellent. We found that physical termite-exclusion completely
eliminated termite-infringement and hence preserved the full sample
size for estimating TBI parameters. Conversely, although chemical
treatment was also successful at excluding termites, it inhibited
microbial decomposition and made TBI estimates unreliable; therefore,
we do not recommend it.

By bench-marking TBI estimates obtained using the original and extended
TBI method, and by validation against time-series decomposition data,
we found that the microbial decomposition rates predicted in our study
were markedly lower than other measurements in tropical and temperate
regions. This is a result that we hope will inspire further work.

We propose an extended TBI to measure both microbial and termite
effects. Physical termite exclusion can be used on some bags to measure
microbial-driven decomposition, and unprotected bags can be used to
measure the contribution of termites in driving litter mass loss. By
characterising both termite- and microbial-driven decomposition,
the extended TBI will provide a comprehensive understanding of
decomposition and its drivers in termite-rich ecosystems, and permit
meaningful global comparisons.
