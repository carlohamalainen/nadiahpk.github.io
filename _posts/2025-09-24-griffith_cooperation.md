Today,
I gave a talk at <a href="https://www.griffith.edu.au/">Griffith University's</a> 
about my two most recent papers about the evolution of cooperation,
published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24590-y">Scientific Reports</a> 
and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519325000554">Journal of Theoretical Biology</a>.

You can download the full slide deck here: <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/evoln_coopn.pdf">evoln_coopn.pdf</a>.

I have taken an adjunct position there, in addition to my position at 
<a href="https://www.qut.edu.au/">QUT</a>,
and I'm looking forward to regular visits to the lovely Nathan Campus,
which is nestled in <a href="https://tooheyforesteec.eq.edu.au/">Toohey Forest</a>.
