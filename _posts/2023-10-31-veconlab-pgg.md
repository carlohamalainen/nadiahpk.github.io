Each year since 2017, I've been taking one lecture for Ryan's subject LSM4255 Methods in Mathematical Biology, teaching evolutionary game theory and adaptive dynamics. After the class, we usually have a tutorial where we play <a href="https://ryanchisholm.com/2017/11/11/students-develop-fishery-management-game-for-teaching-the-tragedy-of-the-commons/">the fishing game</a>, a simulation of a fishery that teaches students about the tragedy of the commons.

Unfortunately, the fishing game was unexpectedly unavailable this year, but I was able to find a very nice last-minute alternative.

Charles Holt at the University of Virginia has made available the <a href="http://veconlab.econ.virginia.edu/">Veconlab software</a>, a collection of 50 web-based experiments ranging from public goods games to auctions.

I just wanted to create a basic linear public goods game, and I was easily able to set one up using the adjustable parameter settings. The game was responsive and performed well during the tutorial. Students were incentivised by the promise of a conversion from dollars earnt to participation marks, and by 10 rounds, we had obtained the classic result of declining contributions.
