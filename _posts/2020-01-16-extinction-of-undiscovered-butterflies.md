[Meryl Theng](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Meryl_Theng) just had a new paper published in [Biological Conservation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000632071931331X?dgcid=coauthor), where she estimated that 46% of Singapore's butterfly species have been extirpated since 1854. The special thing about this estimate is that it includes _all_ species that existed, including species that went extinct before we had a chance to discover them.

The trick to estimating undiscovered extinctions is the SEUX model. There is a nice write-up about the paper on [Ryan's blog](https://ryanchisholm.wordpress.com/2020/01/10/meryls-new-paper-on-singapore-butterfly-extinctions-published-in-biological-conservation/). The paper has also received a good response in the press &#8212; [The Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/study-nearly-half-of-spores-butterfly-species-extinct) and [The Star](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/regional/2020/01/13/nearly-half-of-singapores-butterfly-species-are-extinct) have covered it &#8212; and it is generating some interest on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/uberhyped/status/1215397045063733249) as well. 

Rather than add to all of this, I thought this would be a good opportunity to do a short tutorial, so you can use the same method on your own data. We have created an R package, which you can get from the from the [SEUX R package repo](https://github.com/nadiahpk/seux). 

The first step is to install the package, which I have located at `../seux`.

{% highlight r %}
install.packages("../seux", repos = NULL, type="source")
library("seux")
{% endhighlight %}

Now you should be able to access all of the functions in the package listed below

{% highlight r %}
lsf.str("package:seux")

central_hyper_midP : function (U0, S0, S1, U1, d0)
check_frst_last_detns : function (frstDetn, lastDetn) #... etc.
{% endhighlight %}

In this example, we will work with the Singapore birds historical record from [Chisholm et al. (2016)](https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cobi.12640), which you can download [here](https://github.com/nadiahpk/seux/raw/master/tutorial/example_data/AppendixS5birdspecieslistSingapore.csv). So we'll read that data in:

{% highlight r %}
fName <- "example_data/AppendixS5birdspecieslistSingapore.csv"
raw_data <- read.csv(fName,header=T)
head(raw_data)
{% endhighlight %}

We see that this database contains a list of bird species, the year in which they were first recorded, and the year in which they were last recorded  
{%
    include figure.html
    src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/meryl_table.png"
%}

The SEUX model needs the first and last detections, so we'll make a note of where they are. We can use either the column number or the column header.

{% highlight r %}
frst_col <- 3
last_col <- "Last record"
{% endhighlight %}

Then we feed this into the SEUX model.

The usual workflow steps are:

  1. The `detection_record` of first and last detections of each species is read from a `.csv`;
  2. The `model_inputs`, which is a timeseries of $$ S $$ (detected extant) and $$ E $$ (detected extinct), is created from the `detection_record`;
  3. Confidence intervals and estimates for the unknown $$ U $$ (undetected extant) and $$ X $$ (undetected extinct) can be obtained using the central hypergeometric SEUX model;
  4. Estimates using the method published in Chisholm et al. (2016) can also be obtained.

{% highlight r %}
detection_record <- get_first_last_detections_from_csv(fName, frst_col, last_col)           # 1
model_inputs     <- get_model_inputs( detection_record$frstDetn, detection_record$lastDetn) # 2
CIs_estimates    <- get_CI_estimate( model_inputs$S, model_inputs$E)                        # 3
old_estimates    <- get_old_estimate( model_inputs$S, model_inputs$E )                      # 4

df <- cbind(model_inputs, CIs_estimates, old_estimates)
{% endhighlight %}

The outputs from the models can be plotted using something similar to this:

{% highlight r %}
library(ggplot2)

plot_output <- function(df) {
    
    p <- ggplot(df) + 
     geom_line(aes(year, S,      color="S", linetype="data")) + 
     geom_line(aes(year, E,      color="E", linetype="data")) + 
     geom_line(aes(year, U_mean, color="U", linetype="hyper")) + 
     geom_line(aes(year, U_old,  color="U", linetype="old")) + 
     geom_line(aes(year, X_mean, color="X", linetype="hyper")) + 
     geom_line(aes(year, X_old,  color="X", linetype="old")) +
     scale_color_manual(name="Species class", 
                       values=c(
                                "S"     = "darkgreen", 
                                "E"     = "red",
                                "U"     = "orange",
                                "X"     = "blue"
                                ),
                       labels=c(
                                "S"     = expression(S[t]),
                                "E"     = expression(E[t]),
                                "U"     = expression(U[t]),
                                "X"     = expression(X[t])
                                )
                       ) +
     scale_linetype_manual(name="Method of inferrence", 
                       values=c(
                                "data"  = "solid", 
                                "hyper" = "longdash",
                                "old"   = "dotted"
                                ),
                       labels=c(
                                "data"  = "from data",
                                "hyper" = "hypergeometric",
                                "old"   = "Chisholm et al. (2016)"
                                )
                       ) +
     geom_ribbon(aes(x=year, ymin=X_lo, ymax=X_hi), fill="blue", alpha="0.3") +
     geom_ribbon(aes(x=year, ymin=U_lo, ymax=U_hi), fill="orange", alpha="0.3") +
     xlab('years') +
     ylab('number of species') +
     theme_bw()
    
    return(p)
        
    }

the_plot <- plot_output(df)
print(the_plot)
{% endhighlight %}

Here is a plot of the SEUX results above. The yellow line $$ U_t $$ is the inferred number of undiscovered species over time, and the blue line $$ X_t $$ is the number of species that went extinct before we had a chance to discover them.  

{%
    include figure.html
    src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/output_12_0.png"
%}

And that's it!

Of course, the result above is the 'default' result that can be obtained using the package. If you would like to do a more in-depth analysis, including exploring the effect of unequal extinction rates for discovered and undiscovered species, the further examples in the [Tutorial](https://github.com/nadiahpk/seux/raw/master/tutorial/Tutorial.pdf) will guide you.

As always, I'd love to hear from anyone who plans to use the package; just drop me an email. The package is in development, so I'd also welcome any feedback you have about its use or the supporting documentation.
